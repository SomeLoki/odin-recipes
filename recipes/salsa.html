    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This salsa is a smooth, punchy sauce with a bright tomato base that flows like a dream over chips. IT's got blended ripe tomatoes, a kick of jalapeno heat, a hint of sharp onion and lime to freshen it up. Thinner than a chunky mix, it's got just enough liquid to dip or drizzle. </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>4 medium Ripe Tomatoes (roughly chopped)</li>
        <li>1/2 Red Onion (roughly chopped)</li>

        <li>1/4th cup Fresh Cilantro (chopped)</li>

      </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
      <ol>
        <li>Add chopped tomatoes, red onion, and jalepeno into a blender or food processor.</li>
        <li>Pulse it a few times until it's mostly smooth but still has a little texture - not totally pureed.</li>
        <li>Squeeze in lime juice, add the salt and cilantro and blend it for a quick second to mix.</li>
